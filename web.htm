            AI has become a catchall term for applications that perform complex tasks that once required human input, 
            such as communicating with customers online or playing chess. 
            The term is often used interchangeably with its subfields, 
            which include machine learning (ML) and deep learning.

            Developers use artificial intelligence to more efficiently perform tasks that are otherwise done manually, connect with customers, identify patterns, and solve problems.
             To get started with AI, developers should have a background in mathematics and feel comfortable with algorithms.
